# CensusAir 🧠🌬️

**CensusAir** is a smart AI-powered application that estimates the number of people in an indoor space based on CO₂ levels, temperature, and humidity — using simulated sensor data.

## 🌟 What It Does

CensusAir simulates environmental sensor data and uses a trained AI model to predict how many people are in a given area. The app is built with Python and Streamlit, and is ideal for smart building automation, environmental monitoring, or occupancy analysis.

## 🚀 Key Features

- Simulate CO₂, temperature, and humidity sensor data
- Train and evaluate a machine learning model for occupancy detection
- AI pattern recognition using scikit-learn
- Interactive dashboard with real-time data visualization (via Streamlit)
- No physical sensors required — built entirely with software for demo purposes
