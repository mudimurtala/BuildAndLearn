1 - I have a directory named sales with multiple Excel files. Each file has two columns. The first is the name of a product and has the header Product, and the second is the number of that product sold and has the header Sold. Write a function that reads in that data for further analysis. The data from each file needs to be separate.

2 - Design test cases and a program to unit test the read_sales_data function.
