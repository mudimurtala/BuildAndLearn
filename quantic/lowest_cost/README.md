# ChatGPT Prompt
I have a file with airfares between cities. The data is in the format "origin city | destination city | airfare". Write a program that asks the user what city they're starting in and computes the sequence of cities to visit that results in all cities being visited once and only once at the lowest cost. The output should show the sequence, the cost of each leg, and the total cost.
