# ChatGPT Prompt

I have a text file named website_hits.txt with average website hits per day by city. 
An example of the data is between the '***' lines:
***
Tokyo, Japan: 362
***
Write a program that reads the text file, looks up the location of each city, 
and shows a map with a mark for each city. Clicking the mark should show the number.
