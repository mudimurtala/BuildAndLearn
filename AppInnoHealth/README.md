This is a modern, production-ready web application for InnoHealth Africa Technology, built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It features interactive cards, responsive design, and clean code structure.

## Features

  ```
  The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or the next available port).

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
